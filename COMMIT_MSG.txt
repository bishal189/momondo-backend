  toggle switches, scale with tick marks and 0/100 labels
- Fix matching range: support min=0 and full 0–100% via number inputs; prevent left
  thumb from moving right thumb (clamp + z-index by mouse position); fix React Hooks
  order (useRef before early return)

  History; add Level button in table row for level assignment
